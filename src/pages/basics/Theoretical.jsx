      # framework VS library
        ** framework has enough builtin tools for development basics but in libraries you must need 3rd parties
          *** some frameworks has more than tool to make the same thing ||| also make detailed tools foreash simple or complex feature
          *** so use only basics of the framework that is similar to other frameworks
          *** deep dive in advanced tools after using it in a job
