      # figma
        * UI/UX process steps :
          1- making docs for brain storm ideas & tech. requirements 
            $ [ UX ] [ priority to real user { people interview & survey } ] 
          2- sketching & designing  
        
        *  info :
          - multiple components ( reusable instances “parts” ) [ switch between its items ] - detach -   instance
          - properties ( instant options ) vs variants ( instatnt type )
          - grouping & sections & frames 
          - draw illustration using pen 
          - shapes intersection 
          - image mask => equals frames in canva
          - site map : hierarchical diagrams like tree show navigation in pages
          - color palette => colors you will use in your project
          - figma pages => app page - assets page (components)
          - onboarding page { first page on opening app }
          - design patterns => solutions for common design problems
          - user flow => wire frame => prototype 
            $ user flow : explain features like registration process or searching process
            $ wire frames : pages content like ( home , cart , account ) pages     
            $ prototype ( show in mockups) ( declare [user actions ] Ex. hover )


        * plugins 
          -  images => ( unsplash - freepik ) 
          -  icons => ( material - iconify - streamline ) 
          - illustration graphs => ( blush - illustrations - streamline )   
          - content real to fill content  
          - LottieFiles for animated gifs   
          - remove bg 

          
        * tips & best practices : 
          - use grid & rulers 
          - take ideas from competitors & well designed websites & templates 
          - explain details ( not be lazy )
          -  ( variation ) using many color & sizes & fonts in one part
          - get a continuous feedback team & client  
          - many design options to choose one from them 
          - inputs and interactive feedback ( invalid - valid )
          - use motions => by modify opacity of frame items ( opacity - position - size - rotate - color - effects & filterss ) 
          - use responsive
            $ responsive  ====>>> auto layout & fill container  
            $ constrains ( auto responsive width and height ) 
          - use centralized control & reusability  
            $ local styles Ex. primary color 
            $ variants
            $ components
          - consider all people cases 
            $ accessability & difficulties 
            $ children & ages 
            $ different background & education & jobs
            $ tech knowledge level    
          - use figma community for => 
            $ swm icons 
            $ pre-made components & widgets
